# pdEngine (/Ëˆpdeengyn/)
The pdEngine is a small web game engine for learning purpose as part of my "How to build X" Collection.

## Why Pd?
Pd is the chemical symbol for [Palladium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palladium), which is often used for [catalytic converter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catalytic_converter). A catalytic converter is an exhaust emission control device that converts toxic gases and pollutants in exhaust gas from an internal combustion engine into less-toxic pollutants by catalyzing a redox reaction. Catalytic converters are usually used with internal combustion engines fueled by gasoline or diesel, including lean-burn engines, and sometimes on kerosene heaters and stoves.

In short, catalytic converters are part of a conventional engine, nothing more. Therefore the chemical symbol seems fitting perfectly.
